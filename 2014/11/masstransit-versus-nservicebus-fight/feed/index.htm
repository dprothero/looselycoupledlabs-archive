Hi Lukas, honestly I haven&#039;t used the two frameworks much since then as I&#039;m now a Developer Educator for Twilio. I can say, as I&#039;m still on the mailing lists for both, that both have been under active development with new improvements coming out frequently. That said, the bottom line is probably much the same... MassTransit is highly capable and free of charge. NServiceBus has the expanded toolset and support you&#039;d expect from a commercial offering.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David, thanks for a brief, yet informative comparison. This topic became very actual for me now. 
Would you mind doing a short refresh on it? After all it&#039;s been 2 years and things might have changed a bit since you wrote this article..]]></description>
