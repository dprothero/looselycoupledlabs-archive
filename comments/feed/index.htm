					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really confused by this line:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we use our current example code, however, we will get duplicate messages because each machine is connecting to localhost for its RabbitMQ instance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Assuming we have two app servers and one RMQ server, and both competing consumers are connecting to the same queue name on the single RMQ server, why do we need a cluster?]]></description>

Hi Lukas, honestly I haven&#039;t used the two frameworks much since then as I&#039;m now a Developer Educator for Twilio. I can say, as I&#039;m still on the mailing lists for both, that both have been under active development with new improvements coming out frequently. That said, the bottom line is probably much the same... MassTransit is highly capable and free of charge. NServiceBus has the expanded toolset and support you&#039;d expect from a commercial offering.]]></description>
