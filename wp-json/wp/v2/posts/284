Twilio takes care of the messy telecom hardware and exposes a globally available cloud API that developers can interact with to build intelligent and complex communications systems. To get this role, one of the things I had to do was give\u00a0a live demo of\u00a0<em>something<\/em> (anything really). To illustrate how easy it was to work with the Twilio API, I\u00a0utilized the SMS API to enable two-factor authentication in an ASP.NET MVC web app. The process of walking a bunch of developers (used to writing Python and JavaScript code on their MacBooks) through using Visual Studio was a lot of fun and I must have impressed because I got the job!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/twuts-social\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-285 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Google_Profile.jpg\" alt=\"Google_Profile\" width=\"270\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Google_Profile.jpg 270w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Google_Profile-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Google_Profile-200x200.jpg 200w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Google_Profile-57x57.jpg 57w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Google_Profile-72x72.jpg 72w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Google_Profile-114x114.jpg 114w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Google_Profile-144x144.jpg 144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" \/><\/a>On my first day, I got introduced to a novel new approach to technical and API documentation.\u00a0Today, they are being officially announced. They&#8217;re called\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/twuts-social\" target=\"_blank\">Tutorials <\/a>which sounds simple enough, but instead of putting the narrative first, they put the code first because, let&#8217;s face it, that&#8217;s what us developers are the most interested in seeing anyway. Rather than try to describe it to you, I encourage you to go check it out. Here&#8217;s a great tutorial on how to <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/twuts-cs\" target=\"_blank\">automate an SMS-based workflow<\/a> using C# and ASP.NET MVC. And here&#8217;s another one on how to use <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1UxNllQ\" target=\"_blank\">masked phone numbers<\/a> (just like they do at Airbnb).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-288 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/sms-emp-dir.png\" alt=\"sms-emp-dir\" width=\"259\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/sms-emp-dir.png 562w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/sms-emp-dir-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/sms-emp-dir-150x267.png 150w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/sms-emp-dir-400x712.png 400w, https:\/\/looselycoupledlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/sms-emp-dir-200x356.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" \/>I am excited to be joining the team that puts these excellent tutorials together. I&#8217;m currently working on a company directory that you can query using SMS and get back a photo, full name, email, and phone number of an employee in your company. I created a directory for the fictitious company Marvel Universe, which you can give a spin by sending a text message to: +1-209-337-3517. (Hint, make your text message the name of your favorite Marvel comic hero.) When you do, you&#8217;ll get back the contact info\u00a0as an MMS response.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s just a preview. I&#8217;ll write another blog post once that tutorial has been published. And, you know I&#8217;m going to find a way to use MassTransit with the Twilio API&#8217;s, so stay tuned&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have a new role and I&#8217;m very excited about it.
