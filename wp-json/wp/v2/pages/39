Prior to that, I served\u00a0as both IT Director and Software Engineering Director for Therapeutic Research Center (TRC).

Prior to my tenure with TRC, I served as R&amp;D Manager for Argos Software and Senior Programmer\/Analyst with Cascade Data Solutions.<\/p>\n<p>I love all aspects of building highly scalable systems, including both hardware and software design. I always prefer a simple design over a complex one. Complexity for its own sake sounds like an obviously bad idea, but, as engineers, we are constantly tempted to implement the awe-inspiring \u2013 maybe even intimidating \u2013 monument to our coding prowess. I submit, however, that it takes more chops and creativity to solve the problem at hand with the simplest solution possible.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, not all problems are simple ones. I like to address the real-life complexities of business problems with a well-composed collection of smaller, loosely-coupled systems. Loose coupling is one of the pillars of my design philosophy, hence the name of this blog\u2026 Loosely Coupled Labs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have been providing technical leadership for companies for over 15 years.
